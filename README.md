# WeChat echo service

Example code for a simple echo service that can be used as a WeChat Offical Account (OA). The accompanying blog post that explains it all will be published soon.

You can run this code locally using Node and start up ngrok to tunnel to your app. Your ngrok URL can then be register in the [WeChat debug sandbox](http://admin.wechat.com/debug/sandbox), so all incoming requests for your Official Account are routed to your Node application.
